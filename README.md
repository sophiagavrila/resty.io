# resty.io
A production grade RESTful Spring Boot application started up with minimum fuss.  Utilizes **Apache FreeMarker Java Template Engine** which generates text output (HTML web pages, e-mails, configuration files, source code, etc.) based on templates and changing data.  Templates are written in the FreeMarker Template Language (FTL -- you will see templates ending in `.ftlh`, not `ftl`), which is a simple, specialized language (not a full-blown programming language like PHP). 

- `jar` file may be run with `java -jar RestySpringBoot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
